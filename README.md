This project aims to automatically detect players in sports matches and cluster the detected players based on their jersey colors. The YOLOv8 model was used for object detection, and the VGG16 model was used for feature extraction. Clustering was performed using the K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering algorithms. The accuracy of the model was tested and evaluated using various performance metrics.
